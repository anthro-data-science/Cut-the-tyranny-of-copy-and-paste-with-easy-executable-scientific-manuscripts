## Abstract

A workshop by the Anthro Data Science community (https://anthro-data-science.github.io/)

In this workshop I will demonstrate how to get started writing an executable manuscript as described in a recent Nature technology feature article (https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-00563-z). Executable manuscripts include narrative text (i.e. what we write for a journal article) and data analysis instructions interwoven in a single document. Writing executable manuscripts eliminates copying and pasting between applications, and the errors that can creep in during that process. Executable manuscripts provide outstanding transparency and reproducibility for quantitative research, which is a growing priority for many research fields. Executable manuscripts are especially suitable for researchers already using R or Python for their data analysis and visualization. In this workshop I will guide participants through a hands-on demonstration of this powerful tool for scientific writing, using free and open source software.

We will do hands-on work on a R Markdown document using the examples provided in the Nature article: https://github.com/jperkel/computed_manuscript
